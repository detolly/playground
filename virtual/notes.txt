Looking in binary ninja we can see that it seems like the objects are layered on top of each other.

The struct therefore looks something like this:

struct A
{
    vtable* w1;
    int x;
    vtable* w2;
    int y;
    int z;
};

for functions accepting W1/V1 vtable, you pass (A+0).
for functions accepting W2/V2 vtable, you pass (A+12 (8+4)).
for functions accepting A, you pass (A+0), since it knows the whole definition.
