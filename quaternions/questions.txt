After watching tons of videos, I still don't understand quaternions.

Here are some questions:

    * What's so special about the real part of a quaternion?
        - It feels like physics class where you're using the equations without really understanding what's going on. Stereographic projections did nothing for me.

    * How was it intuitive for Hamilton to perform a quaternion operation, and then perform the inverse afterwards?
        - After all, he didn't have computers or advanced visualization tools.
        - Did he not forsee that the inverse would have to be applied, but ran with it anyway?

    * Are there other rules that would make sense for quaternions?

    * What's actually happening in the 4th dimension? Can we visualize a rotation of 4D hyperspheres with quaternions?

    * Why is the formula real * cos(angle) + (imaginary) * sin(angle)? Can we visualize this?

Extra goodies:

    * Can we visualize a pure hypersphere rotation and make it intuitive?

Side notes:

    * Quaternions are pretty much the recipe for the vector cross-product. Nobody really mentions this, not sure why.
    * 4D can be expressed as a sequence of 3D spaces. It should be able to capture the quaternion operations by treating the final dimension as a temporal dimension.
        - What does this 3D space represent? My intuition is we're interested in the 3D space on the surface of the 4D unit sphere.
        - So what would this look like?
            1. Take all the points on the surface of the hypersphere.
            2. Multiply them by a quaternion and apply the rules.
            3. Visualize along a chosen dimension by the 
            The rules of quaternions:
                i²+j²+k²=ijk=-1.
                ij=-ji=k, jk=-kj=i, ki=-ik=j.
            Let v = 0 + 1i + 0j + 0k. Let q = 0 + 0i + 1j + 0k.

            p = v * q
            p = 1k
